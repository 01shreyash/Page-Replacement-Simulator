# Page Replacement Algorithms Simulator 

A web-based simulator for **Page Replacement Algorithms** in Operating Systems:
- **FIFO (First-In-First-Out)**
- **Optimal**
- **LFU (Least Frequently Used)**

Built using **HTML, CSS (Bootstrap), and JavaScript** for step-by-step visualization.

---

##  Features
- Interactive UI for entering reference strings & frame size.
- Step-by-step simulation with highlights.
- Calculates **Hits, Page Faults, Hit Rate, Fault Rate**.
- Supports multiple algorithms with easy navigation.

---

##  Structure
- `index.html` → Main menu.
- `fifo.html` → FIFO simulation.
- `optimal.html` → Optimal simulation.
- `lfu.html` → LFU simulation.
- `screenshots/` → Add screenshots of outputs.

---

##  Usage
1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Select the algorithm you want to simulate.
3. Enter:
   - Reference string (space-separated, e.g., `7 0 1 2 0 3 0 4`)
   - Number of frames (e.g., `3`)
4. Click **Simulate** to view step-by-step results.
